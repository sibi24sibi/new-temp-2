Image Usage Documentation

This document serves to clarify the use of images in the project and explain the contents of the images folder.

Image Hosting:
All images used in this project have been uploaded to PostImages and are accessed through online links. These cloud-hosted images are referenced directly in the project files (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

Local Images:
The images folder contains local copies of all images for reference purposes only. These images are not used directly in the deployed version of the project.

Image Management:
If any images are updated or added:
Upload the updated image to PostImages.
Replace the image link in the project with the new hosted URL.

Image Folder Maintenance:
Since local images are only for reference:
This folder may be periodically cleaned or updated.
Unused images can be safely deleted if verified as no longer relevant.

Summary:
Cloud-hosted images are used to ensure faster loading and easier image management.
The images folder is a reference directory only, not linked to the project runtime.
